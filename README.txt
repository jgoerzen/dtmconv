DTM to Opie Converter

This tool is used to convert from Sharp's proprietary Zaurus PIM
storage format used on its newer ROMs to the XML format used by Opie.
It is useful whenever you are migrating from a Sharp ROM to something
such as OpenZaurus on your device.

dtmconv currently supports converting these items:

 * To-do list: full conversion except for categories

 * Address book: full conversion except for categories

 * Datebook: partial conversion (see note below)

 * Categories: no conversion
